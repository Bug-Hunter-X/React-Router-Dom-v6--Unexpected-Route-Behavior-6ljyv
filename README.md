# React Router Dom v6: Unexpected Route Behavior

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in React Router Dom v6 related to unexpected route behavior.  Under certain conditions, routes may render incorrectly or fail to match expected paths. The issue is difficult to reproduce consistently but is commonly seen when nesting routes or using dynamic segments.  The `bug.js` file shows a minimal example exhibiting the problem, and `bugSolution.js` presents a solution.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   `cd <project_directory>`
3. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
4. Run the application:
   `npm start`

## Bug Description

The primary issue is inconsistent routing behavior; routes do not always match their defined paths, potentially leading to unexpected page renders or blank screens.

## Solution

The provided solution in `bugSolution.js` addresses this behavior. The core change involves carefully reviewing path definitions in the routes to ensure they cover all potential routing scenarios and handle edge cases.
